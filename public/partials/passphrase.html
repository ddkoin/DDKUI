The day we officially launched DDK Blockchain Mainnet it will be in BETA MODE. The platform is still under a strict monitoring from Audit team and developers on the features, functions, UI and performance as it is still fragile.<br />2. This is a New Wallet and New Core, thus in the event that there is a roll back which the probability is VERY LOW (just in case), <strong>please remain calm as the DDK Developers&nbsp;</strong> <strong>will be on standby in order to ensure that it will be a smooth running platform</strong>.<br />3. Within a week, there will be a few other upgrading which concurrently working in progress (WIP) as below: <br/><p>
                
                </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Airdrop Statistics Page that the DDK Developers enhanced for a better UI and user-friendly features <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;b. SENDSTAKE function<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Chain Referral that have broken chain from the Upline and downline<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d. PENDING GB features</p><br />4. On the Global Exchanges integration that we have finalized, with the advice from DDK Developers and Auditors team, we decided <strong>not to open directly on the day of</strong><br /><strong>launching Mainnet itself for SIMEX exchangers, however we will stick with the</strong><strong>timeline by End of April 2019 to launch both exchangers (www.dobiexchange.com)</strong> that we have engaged. This decision is also to allow the Mainnet BETA MODE to be smooth and working perfectly for exchange and trading activities. Meanwhile, you may continue with the rest transactions and features available as your wish ðŸ˜Š (P2P, Stake, 2nd Passphrase, Vote, and etc). Any additional information pertaining to the GE, will be given in timely manner.<br />5. In addition, there will be a new DDK Explorer link provided for you to check and verify on each transactions and history made - https://mainnetexplorer.ddkoin.com/ .However, at this moment it is not applicable yet until further notice. Kindly refer to the Dashboard for your transaction confirmation. We will do the syncronization on  this explorer soonest possible.<br />6. Every Existing loyal users from ETPS centralized platform may redeem your passphrase with the link provided - https://webwallet.ddkoin.com/existingETPSUser .<br />7. Moreover, every existing loyal users from ETPS centralized platform that have migrated their account to decentralized DDK Blockchain platform may check the transaction using ETPS username with the link provided - https://foundation.ddkoin.com/migrated_users_info_public<br />8. We extended our support towards entire Stakeholders and our Blockchain AEPOS supporters by providing another two (2) additional channel of support apart from DDKoin_Official facebook page for your ease of communication as below:<br /><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Support Email -support@ddkoin.com<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;b. 24/7 Web Chat &ndash; www.ddkoin.com</p><br />We really hope that this GOOD NEWS for all of our community will be spread in positivity as we are moving towards decentralization world as the 1st platform in Asia to benefits more than 240,000 DDKOIN token holders.
